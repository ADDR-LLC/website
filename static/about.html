                    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                    <p>Drones have seen rapid adoption in industries like agriculture, 
                        videography, and logistics. We as ADDR see drones having potential 
                        in life-saving scenarios, aiming for the greatest possible impact 
                        within disaster response and search and rescue operations.</p>

                    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
                    <p>Leveraging AI advancements and powerful hardware, 
                        we envision a flexible network of autonomous drones 
                        working with a master AI system to rapidly access 
                        hard-to-reach areas and streamline emergency response 
                        and communication. Our ultimate goal is to reduce response 
                        times and make rescue operations more accurate and efficient, 
                        and remove the possibility of any type of error. In the future, 
                        we plan to expand into the different horizons of the drone technology.
