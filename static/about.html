    <h1>About ADDR</h1>
    
    <div class="info_box" id="mission_box">
        <h2><i class="fas fa-bullseye fa-fade"></i> Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Drones have seen rapid adoption in industries like agriculture, 
            videography, and logistics. We as ADDR see drones having potential 
            in life-saving scenarios, aiming for the greatest possible impact 
            within disaster response and search and rescue operations.</p>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-eye fa-fade"></i> Our Vision</h2>
        <p>Leveraging AI advancements and powerful hardware, 
            we envision a flexible network of autonomous drones 
            working with a master AI system to rapidly access 
            hard-to-reach areas and streamline emergency response 
            and communication. Our ultimate goal is to reduce response 
            times and make rescue operations more accurate and efficient, 
            and remove the possibility of any type of error. In the future, 
            we plan to expand into the different horizons of the drone technology.</p>
